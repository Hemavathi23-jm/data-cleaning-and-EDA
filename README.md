🛳️ Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data preprocessing and exploratory analysis workflow using the Titanic public dataset. 
The focus is on transforming raw data into a clean, structured format and extracting actionable insights using Python. 

🎯 Key Objectives
Clean and preprocess real-world data
Handle missing values and incorrect data types
Perform exploratory data analysis using visualizations
Identify key factors influencing passenger survival 

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab 

🔄 What Was Done
Imputed missing values (Age, Embarked) and removed irrelevant features
Converted categorical variables for better analysis
Created visualizations to analyze survival trends by gender, class, age, and fare
Used correlation analysis to understand feature relationships 

📊 Key Insights
Females and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates
Passenger class and gender were the strongest survival indicators
Higher fares and younger age groups showed better survival chances 

🚀 Outcome
Delivered a clean, analysis-ready dataset
Built a reusable EDA framework applicable to other domains
Strengthened practical skills in data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation
